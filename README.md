# Air Quality Regression in R üåøüåè‚ôªÔ∏è
Year: 2024

This project explores the relationship between various environmental factors and air pollution levels using simple & multivariable linear regression in R. 

## Project Overview
This project involved exploring multivariable air quality data and applying a structured regression modelling process. Key steps included analysing variable correlations, one-hot encoding categorical variables, formulating initial models, and validating model assumptions. The analysis also involved variable transformations, identifying influential outliers, performing ANOVA, conducting stepwise variable selection, and comparing models using the Partial F-test. The final models were interpreted in the context of air pollution predictors. 

This repo was a personal project to apply regression analysis techniques to environmental data.

## Data Source: 
Pollution.csv (supplied) dataset is a publicly available air pollution dataset commonly used in regression modelling education, originating from U.S. regional environmental data.

## Programming Language: 
R and R markdown. Use R Studio for this code - 'Run All' and then use the Outline to move around.  
Otherwise see HTML knitted file for code and outputs. 

## Dependencies
When RStudio is open, install required packages either following the prompts or running `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "readr"))` in the terminal.  
Ensure that the Pollution.csv file is located in the working directory.
